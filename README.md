Dashen, an Artificial Intelligence Gradutate project
====================================================

Repository for the Dashen project.

Use the docs folder to add some additional documentation. Don't hesitate to do it !

## Git usage

Don't directly code into master. For any new feature, work on a new branch and make a pull request when done.

## Reminder

Coding guideline: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html (only look at the relevant parts)

Variables and method names should (at least a little) speak for themselves

Don't forget to add comments in your code !! 

[Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) documentation, just like JavaDoc !
